This project is a sample website/landing page I created to practice HTML and CSS. I started out following TOP's reference template (overall design, colors, and font styles), but along the way I decided to fill in the content with some info about my favorite band.

In the process of making this site, I've improved my Flexbox knowledge and  learned the necessary functions to implement in a good design. Furthermore, I've honed in on my HTML skills, particularly in nesting and container division.

The image credits go to myself (for the concert photo) and My Chemical Romance (for the album cover art/photos). The links I've included are the band's various music pages (Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube) as well as their official website.
